# dragover-files

I want a gui similar to that of the mac dropover. There should be a small window with centered text with Good font written DropOver and after files dropped in it, the text disappears and then the file is there, with the name of the file that is dropped and the icon of the category the file/folder belongs to, if the user drags out the file/folder from the gui, which would be modern and would look good with hover effects and rounded borders etc, the file would behave as same as they were dropped in the gui. The files should stack like flexbox or something if there are many files dropped, and files could be dropped one after another, the files could be removed by click a cross icon at the top right of the file and which appears only at hover and has 50% rounded borders, it should also have the functionality to select multiple files with pressing the control button, and drag and drop collectively.
